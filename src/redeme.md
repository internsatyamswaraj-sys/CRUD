# CRUD Operations API â€“ Node.js + MySQL

##  Overview
The purpose of this project is to help interns learn and implement backend API development using **Node.js (TypeScript + Fastify)** and **MySQL** as the database.  
The APIs cover basic CRUD operations (**Create, Read, Update, Delete**) on two resources (**Users** and **Addresses**) with ORM-based database interactions.

---

##  Objectives
- Build a simple but production-style backend application.  
- Implement CRUD APIs with request/response validation.  
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety.  
- Store and retrieve data from **MySQL** using ORM (**Sequelize / TypeORM**).  
- Write clean, maintainable code with proper folder structure.  
- Add basic API documentation (Swagger / README).  
- Introduce relational mapping between **User** and **Address**.
